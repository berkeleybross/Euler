Euler

# Reading

Each problem and solution can be found in ~/Problems
Each solution is written as a unit test, alongside other tests to prove correctness of stages to solving the problem.
Rough timings are provided, by running the test framework several times and mentally averaging out the run times.

| Problem                        | Solution | Timing |
| ------------------------------ | -------- | ------ |
| 1 - Multiples of 3 and 5       | 233168   | 2ms    |
| 4 - Largest palindrome product | 906609   | 50ms   |
| 18 - Maximum path sum I        | 1074     | 4ms    |
| 67 - Maximum path sum II       | 7273     | 23ms   |

# Running

To run, have node and yarn installed.

In the base directory:

yarn install
yarn run test

All tests should pass to prove they calculate the correct answer.
